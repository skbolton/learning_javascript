# Learning JavaScript - Ethan Brown
This is going to be my run through the book Learning JavaScript by Ethan Brown. I have chosen to go through this book since I have really enjoyed other works that the author has done and because it is very current. The book focuses on ES6, something that I have not done a lot with but understand a little bit about.

As I am reading the book I will update the readme with lessons learned and reflections.

## Chapter 1 - hello world
This is not my first hello world I have done in javascript (I am actually a little embarrassed by how many I have done). I do have to say though that this is by far my favorite. It might be a little heavy for some beginners to be loading so many external libraries, but for me it was a lot of fun to have a more interactive hello world to work on. This was a good chapter looking forward to the rest of the book!

## Chapter 2 - Development Tool
Super excited for this chapter as I am a tool junkie and love this stuff. Also happy that in this chapter he is going with gulp and not grunt *I really don't like grunt's way of doing things*
