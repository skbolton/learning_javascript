# Learning JavaScript - Ethan Brown
This is going to be my run through the book Learning JavaScript by Ethan Brown. I have chosen to go through this book since I have really enjoyed other works that the author has done and because it is very current. The book focuses on ES6, something that I have not done a lot with but understand a little bit about. 

As I am reading the book I will update the readme with lessons learned and reflections.
